# CloudWallet

The android native client version of my Cloud Wallet Project.

Don't try to remember every credit card, email, forum and account password of yours. Store them with Cloud Wallet in the skydrive and get them needed.

This project is about storing valuable information (like bank account numbers and passwords, email, facebook, twitter and other important internet account passwords, identity numbers etc.. in an encrypted (AES encryption) file. If the file will stored in skydrive then the file will be reachable from Cloud Wallet 's windows mobile 7, desktop, windows 8. Those files could be reached safely.
